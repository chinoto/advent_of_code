# My Advent of Code Solutions

Run a solver with `cargo run YYYY DP`, where `YYYY` is the year, `D` is the day, and `P` (for part) is either `a` or `b`.

Input is given to a solver via stdin. I've been pasting the input directly into the terminal and pressing `Ctrl+D` to flush input to the program.
